# Eight-Puzzle-game-Python-Project
This is my final project for Intro to Computer Science class. The project was to make an Eight Puzzle game. The Eight Puzzle is a sliding puzzle game that consists of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective of the game is to rearrange the tiles to match by sliding the tiles into the blank space in the least number of moves.

The Board class initializes a 3x3 grid using a provided string of digits, representing the puzzle's tiles. It includes methods to move the blank tile (move_blank), return a string representation of the current board state (digit_string), and create a deep copy of the board (copy). These methods allow for manipulation and representation of the board state, supporting the generation of possible moves and transitions.

The State class is designed to encapsulate a specific board configuration. The constructor (__init__) initializes the state with attributes such as the current board, predecessor state, move taken to reach the state, and the number of moves from the initial state (num_moves). The class includes a method to check if the current state is the goal state (is_goal) and another to generate all possible successor states (generate_successors). This method creates copies of the board, attempts all possible moves, and constructs new state objects for each valid move, facilitating the exploration of the state space in search algorithms.

The 5_moves.txt file and 10_moves.txt file contain multiple board configurations for the Eight Puzzle. Each line in the file represents a different state of the puzzle. These configurations can be used as test cases for algorithms designed to solve the puzzle.
